					Synthetics is a conference about semiotics, linguistics, typography, and the intersections of these disciplines. Synthetics is an evaluation of the inherited systems (language) that dictate function in an era of rapid globalization, addressing how various artists and designers are dealing with the external (commercial) and internal (personal) parameters that these systems establish.
